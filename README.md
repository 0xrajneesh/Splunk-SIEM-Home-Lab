# Splunk Home Lab

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èOverview

This is the most powerful home-lab focused on setting up Splunk SIEM and real-world use cases. If you‚Äôre interested to become SOC Analyst(Tier 1/2) , this lab will help you with SOC tools, rules, queries, apps and integration.

## </> Setting up Splunk SIEM on Ubuntu Server
- Install Splunk Enterprise software on Ubuntu server    
- Install Splunk [Security Essentials App]((https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435))  
- Import [BOTS V2 Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv2/botsv2_data_set_attack_only.tgz)  

## üßë‚ÄçüíªExcercises- Investigating Web-based attacks
- **SQL Injection**: Analyze web logs to detect potential SQL injection attempts.(Hint: Look for unusual characters or SQL keywords used in URI parameters, such as ' or 1=1.)  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Monitor web logs for signs of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.(Hint: Search for requests containing suspicious JavaScript keywords like "script", "<script>", or "onload".)   
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery**: Identify potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in web logs.(Hint: Look for requests with unexpected or unauthorized actions, such as changes in user settings or profile information.)  
- **Directory Traversal**: Search for indications of Directory Traversal attacks in web logs.(Hint:  Check for requests containing "../" or "%2e%2e/" sequences in the URI, attempting to access files outside the web root.)
- **Brute Force**: Monitor access logs for patterns indicative of brute force attacks.(Hint: Look for repeated login attempts from the same IP address or requests with multiple failed authentication attempts.)  
- **Session Hijacking**: Detect potential session hijacking attempts by analyzing web logs.(Hint: Look for multiple logins from different IP addresses for the same user account in a short time frame.)  
- **Remote Code Execution**: Identify potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) attempts in web logs.(Hint: Look for requests with unusual file extensions or commands that may indicate attempts to execute arbitrary code on the server.)  
- **XXL External Entity**: Search for indications of XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in web logs.(Hint: Look for requests with XML payloads containing references to external entities or unusual XML processing instructions.)  
- **Insecure Deserialization Detection**: Detect potential Insecure Deserialization attempts in web logs.(Hint: Look for requests with serialized data or references to known serialization libraries vulnerable to exploitation.)  
- **SSRF Detection**: Monitor web logs for signs of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.(Hint: Look for requests with URLs pointing to internal or sensitive resources, or containing unexpected protocols like "file://" or "gopher://".)

## üßë‚ÄçüíªExcercises- Investigating Network-based attacks
- **Port Scanning**: Detect port scanning activities in network logs.(Hint: Look for a large number of connection attempts from the same source IP to different destination ports within a short time frame.)  
- **DDoS Attack**: Identify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in network logs.(Hint:  Watch for a sudden increase in traffic volume or a high number of connection requests to a single destination IP or port from multiple source IPs.)   
- **Brute Force SSH Attack**: Detect brute force SSH login attempts in authentication logs.(Hint: Check for repeated failed login attempts from the same source IP address within a short time frame.)  
- **DNS Tunneling**:  Identify DNS tunneling activities in DNS logs.(Hint: Look for DNS queries with abnormally large query sizes, which may indicate DNS tunneling attempts to exfiltrate data.)
- **Malicious Payload**: Detect known malicious payloads in network logs using Suricata IDS or Zeek IDS.(Hint:  Search for network logs containing signatures or indicators associated with known malware or exploit kits.)  
- **Malicious File Download**:  Detect malicious file downloads in HTTP server logs.(Hint: Search for HTTP requests with file extensions commonly associated with malware, such as ".exe" or ".dll".)  
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Identify network reconnaissance activities in network logs using Suricata IDS.(Hint: Look for network logs containing events indicative of port scanning activities, such as multiple connection attempts from the same source IP to different destination IPs.)  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Detect potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks in network logs.(Hint: Look for network logs indicating rejected connections or SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake, which may suggest ARP spoofing or MitM attacks.)  
- **Data Exfiltration**:  Identify data exfiltration attempts in network logs.(Hint: Look for network logs containing large outbound data transfers or unusually high volumes of data transmitted from internal to external destinations, which may indicate data exfiltration attempts.)
